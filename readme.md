### Exercises 4 - Angular Components

You can find implementation from exercises in the directory `Exercises 4/stock-market`.
Setup instructions for installing and running angular can be found in the file `Exercises 4/angular_setup.md`.

In this exercise we implemented a simple stock market application and demonstrated the use of components, data binding (text interpolation and property binding), event binding and pipes.

In this exercises there is also homework assigned, which is to implement a simple e-commerce website (directory `Exercises 4/homework1`).

### Exercises 5 - Angular Directives, Input and Output, Content Projection

You can find implementation from exercises in the directory `Exercises 5/ecommerce`.
