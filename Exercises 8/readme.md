## Exercises 8 - Reactive Forms

You can find implementation from exercises in the directory `Exercises 8/reactive-forms`.

In this exercises we created reactive form for user login on ecommerce website. We demonstrated use of FormControl, FormGroup, FormArray and FormBuilder classes for work with forms, groups and controls. Beside that we also covered built-in and custom validators and error codes. We used bootsrap for styling of the page.

### Homework 4
